## Issues
Scoring incomplete
Score display incomplete

Seats must be checked by ticket limit, tickets and event avail. So far only ticket checked
Database: event avail checking too simple as we can have more tickets than event seats (if multiple ticket options)
    block user on too many pendings (OK)
    invoice handling    

registration: create password on first booking, to be saved in app (recorded)
show registration info on home page


## Extensions
Event Feedback? On QR Code
Event Info: modal on event


## Tools
bgpip.php: remember to change init file location on server
